## What would it look like it you designed your own Master's degree?

That's a question I've been toying with all this year.

When we entered The Covid Times back in March <Footnote idName={1}>Or perhaps 99 years ago, I've lost count now.</Footnote>, I was lined up to begin an [MSc in Digital Anthropology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/study/graduate-taught/digital-anthropology-msc) at UCL (University College London). I'd had my eye on the degree programme for years and finally carved out the time for it in 2020. Turns out I carved into the wrong year.

With London currently in **Tier 4  lockdown**, I've decided to defer my place until September 2021. <Footnote idName={2}>With the highly optimistic notion we might be allowed to do a reasonable amount of in-person research and teaching by then. I won't be betting money on it.</Footnote>

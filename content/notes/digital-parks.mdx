<IntroParagraph>
    
Eli Parser recently wrote a piece in Wired suggesting we need the digital equivalent of [public parks](https://www.wired.com/story/to-mend-a-broken-internet-create-online-parks/). Online gathering spaces outside of the InstaFaceTwit walled gardens. Spaces that allow groups of people to gather without their interactions being mediated by the commerical interests of private platforms.

</IntroParagraph>

The piece makes a beautiful analogy to the public parks Walt Whitman advocated for in mid-19th century America. Open communal spaces that became anchor points in neighbourhoods â€“ areas to assemble, socialise, and be visible within a community. To see and be seen.

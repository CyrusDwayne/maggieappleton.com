This post is more of a question than a guide.

As of this week, I've deferred my place in the MSc programme in [Digital Anthropology at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/study/graduate-taught/digital-anthropology-msc)  until next September. <Footnote idName={1}>With the highly optimistic notion we might be allowed to do a some in-person research and teaching by then. I won't be betting money on it.</Footnote>

With Covid lockdown being what it is, and the state of online education being what it is, I've had to reluctantly conclude 2020 is not the year to be doing a degree within traditional academic structures. Especially not one that primarily focuses on in-person [ethnographic fieldwork](https://www.anthroencyclopedia.com/entry/ethnography). In a nation where most in-person interaction is currently banned.

However, I have no intention of putting my education on pause for the next 10 months. I had already reduced my working hours as a designer at [egghead]($https://egghead.io/) to make extra room for the masters.

I now have the luxurious burden of time, mental bandwidth, and an overwhelming desire to explore a few very specific areas of research.  Which presents a wonderful design challenge:

## How do I design an independent educational structure outside the boundaries of a formal institution?

Obviously, this is not a novel question. 

Homeschoolers, [unschoolers](https://zenhabits.net/unschool/), [bootcampers](https://lambdaschool.com/), [MOOCers](), and [Ultralearners](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/) have all been extensively exploring it in different forms.

The habitual practice and ethos of being a "life long learner," alongside a dissmistive distain for "The Educational Establishment" runs deep in the communities I spend time in. Self-directed, as-hoc education is a requirement for anyone doing Very Online knowledge work.

At this point, building an online space with a record of your educational trail, analytical reflections, opinions, and explorations is a professional requirement.

However, what I'm talking about is **more contained and designed** than the kind of ambient background learning we're always engaged in as cushy white-collar internet workers.  

I'm talking about a very **intentional, planned, and self-enforced** project.  
One wth...
- a (flexible) curriculum of learning material
- practical assignments with deadlines
- time structures and contained periods

I found very few examples of other people putting together their own explicit curriculums, structures, and schedules outside of the [10,000 homeschooling mums](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/search/pins/?q=independent%20learning%20plan) performatively showcasing their unpaid carework on Pinterest.



Anyway, the point is my googling for "independent graduate degree" or "self-directed masters" turned up very few results, so I'm writing the post I wanted to find.

## What does this 

Let's get into the design aspects of this.

What "jobs" does a masters degree from a formal educational institution usually do?

Whether formal institutional degrees are “worth it” of an enormous debate for another time. 

I should unequivocally state **this is a speculative plan**. 
As I progress through it, I'll find what does and doesn't work. I'll adjust course as needed. Self-reflection and revision is built into the system. Every four weeks I plan the curriculum for the next four, which gives me enough flexibility to adjust as i go.

## Designing Cybernetic Systems

As a child one of my favourite books was [Cheaper by the Dozen](https://www.librarything.com/work/33070) - a story about efficiency expert Frank Gilbreth and his household of twelve children that he ran like a Fordist automation factory. <Footnote idName={2}>An early sign of my worrying preoccupation with the [Protestant Work Ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic). </Footnote>

Even at eleven, systems design and automation felt uniquely compelling to me. There is something about the relationship between people and machines in co-dependent loops that feels magical and shiny. You and your laptop are a  Cybernetic system designing one another as you go along.

## Locking the Golden Handcuffs

In my opinion, committment is one of the most valuable jobs a formal institution can offer.

Making it easy, logical, and socially obligatory for you to show up and do the work. Every piece of physical and social infrastructure within a university is designed to accommodate you doing the work.

In lieu of class times, peers, professors, assignment deadlines, and enormous social pressure to show up and do the work, I've just got APIs.

### Beeminder to the Rescue

There's a service called **Beeminder** I cannot speak highly enough of.  
Just like [Marmite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmite), it's an acquired taste. When I describe it to folks, the reaction is always strongly split between curious enthusiasm or repulsive disgust. 

Built by a cadre of engineer-academics, it's a financially-enforced habit tracking system.  You commit to doing a certain amount of something over a set period of time – run three times a week, write 200 words a day, or read 6 hours a month – and connect up a tracking app that proves you've done it.   

If you don't follow through on your committment, you pay for it. Financially. You literally give your debit card details when you sign up, and set how much you want to put at stake. The penalty amounts start small ($1, $5), and slightly increase each time you fall off the "yellow brick road" of your commitment.

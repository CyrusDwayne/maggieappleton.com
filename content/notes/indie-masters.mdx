This post is more of a question than a guide.

As of this week, I've deferred my place in the MSc programme in [Digital Anthropology at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/study/graduate-taught/digital-anthropology-msc)  until next September. <Footnote idName={1}>With the highly optimistic notion we might be allowed to do a some in-person research and teaching by then. I won't be betting money on it.</Footnote>

I'd been wanting to do the degree for the better part of seven years. But with Covid lockdown being what it is, and the state of online education being what it is, I've had to reluctantly conclude 2020 is not the year to be doing a degree within traditional academic structures. 

Especially not one that primarily focuses on in-person [ethnographic fieldwork](https://www.anthroencyclopedia.com/entry/ethnography). In a nation where most in-person interaction is currently banned.

However, I have no intention of putting my education on pause for the next 10 months. I've already reduced my working hours at [egghead](https://egghead.io/) to make  space for the masters. Which means I now face the luxurious burden of time, mental bandwidth, and an overwhelming desire to explore a few very specific areas of research.   
Which presents a wonderful design challenge:

> How do I design an independent educational programme without the structure of a formal institution?

Obviously, this is not a novel question. 

Homeschoolers, [unschoolers](https://zenhabits.net/unschool/), [bootcampers](https://lambdaschool.com/), [MOOCers](), and [Ultralearners](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/) have all been extensively exploring it in different forms.

The habitual practice and ethos of being a _life-long learner_, alongside a dissmissive distain for "The Educational Establishment" runs deep in the communities I spend time in. Self-directed, as-hoc education is a requirement for anyone doing Very Online knowledge work.

At this point, building an online space with a record of your educational trail, analytical reflections, opinions, and explorations is essentially a professional requirement.

However, what I'm talking about is **more contained and designed** than the kind of ambient background learning we're always engaged in as cushy white-collar internet workers.  

I'm talking about a very **intentional, planned, and enforced** learning project.  One that includes...
- A pre-planned curriculum of learning material
- Practical assignments with deadlines
- Daily, weekly, and monthly time structures
- A completion date

I found very few examples of other people putting together their own explicit curriculums, structures, and schedules outside of the [10,000 homeschooling mums](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/search/pins/?q=independent%20learning%20plan) performatively showcasing their unpaid carework on Pinterest.



Anyway, the point is my googling for "independent graduate degree" or "self-directed masters" turned up very few results, so I'm writing the post I wanted to find.

## Designing a Degree

I should first unequivocally state that **this is a speculative plan**. 

As I progress through it, I'll find what does and doesn't work, and adjust course as needed. Self-reflection and revision is built into the system. Every four weeks I'll reflect and plan the curriculum for the next four, which gives me enough flexibility to adjust as I go.



## Becoming a Cybernetic System

As a child one of my favourite books was [Cheaper by the Dozen](https://www.librarything.com/work/33070) - a story about efficiency expert Frank Gilbreth and his household of twelve children that he ran like a Fordist automation factory. <Footnote idName={2}>An early sign of my worrying preoccupation with the [Protestant Work Ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic). </Footnote>

Even at eleven, systems design and automation felt particularly compelling. There is something about the relationship between people and mechanical systems in co-dependent loops that feels magical and shiny. You and your laptop are a  Cybernetic system designing one another as you go along.

## Locking the Golden Handcuffs

In my opinion, committment is one of the most valuable services a formal institution can offer.

Every piece of physical and social infrastructure within a university is designed to make it easy, logical, and socially obligatory for you to show up and do the work.

In lieu of peers, professors, class times, assignment deadlines, and enormous social pressure to stay the course, I've just got APIs. They're definitely not as good, but they're better than nothing.



### Beeminder, Toggl, and Todoist

These three are the core 

There's a service called [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) that I cannot speak highly enough of.  

Just like [Marmite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmite), it's an acquired taste. When I describe it to folks, the reaction is always strongly split between curious enthusiasm or repulsive disgust. 

Built by a cadre of engineer-academics, it's a **financially-enforced habit tracking system**.  You commit to doing a certain amount of something over a set period of time – run three times a week, write 200 words a day, or read 6 hours a month – and connect up a tracking app that proves you've done it.   

If you don't follow through on your committment, you pay for it. __Financially.__ You enter your debit card details when you sign up, and set how much you want to put at stake. The penalty amounts start small ($1-5), and slightly increase each time you fall through on your commitment.

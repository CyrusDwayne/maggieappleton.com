<IntroParagraph>

While the web has been through a number of metaphorical periods – the information superhighway, the series of tubes, the global village, and the zero-gravity parallel universe of __cyberspace__ – none is so enduring as the piece of paper.

</IntroParagraph>

Ever since XEROX Parc designed the Dilbert-esque [desktop metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor), our whole digital experience has been structured in terms of dull office equipment.

Documents, folders, rubbish bins, bookmarks, windows, and talking paperclips are the visual language of our operating systems and they haven't fundamentally changed since the 1970's.

This metaphorical system became the foundation of how we think about the web. 
Websites are primaily thought of as **pages**.
We imagine the web as a flat stack of documents with information presented on them.

## The Nature of Static Paper

They are specifically __static__ paper placed in certain locations that we **go to**. They have a permanent **address**, and we say we have __visited__ a page. We __follow__ links and end up __on__ a website. It's a classic example of a [blended metaphor]() – we've combined paper documents and geographical locations to create this emergent notion of location-based pages.

## Thinking in Geological Layers

The paper metaphor of the web hides almost everything about the web. We are presented with shiny graphical interfaces that offer us a limited range of options. Would you like to tweet, like, or link to this piece of text?

Rather than seeing the web as a flat, inert object we passively read, what if we saw the web as an interactive topology made up of various layers?

This is closer to how developers see a web page – as a set of systems they can layer on top of one another, connect to, and expand off.

When you're building a webpage, you're patching together a set of features and affordances. Do you want to add the ability to login? Do you want to integrate the Facebook like button? Do you want to let people enter text and save it to a database in the cloud? All of these options touch on different infrastructure layers of the web. 

There's a data layer. There's a security layer. There's a visual design layer. There's a hypertext layer that links to other locations. There's an authentication layer. There's an algorithmic layer. There are the fundamental protocols of TCP/IP holding up the web that very few people understand.

Almost all of these layers are completely invisible to people using the web. They just see a page. A flat static page. There is no topography. There is no transparency to how this website is structured or built. You don't know what other websites it's connected it, or where it's pulling data in from. The amount of technical literacy you need to even begin to see these layers is non-trivial.
